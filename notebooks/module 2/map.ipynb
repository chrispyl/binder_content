    "A common programming task is to apply the same function to collections of data. A common technique to do this is by using a `for` loop, meaning that a piece of code is evaluated repeatedly for a range of values. For big data applications, it would be better to have a more concise technique to perform this procedure. This technique is called `map`, and most programming languages have it implemented as a function. `Map` applies a function to a collection of data <u>elementwise</u> (to each individual element) and returns a collection containing the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Map` allows to break calculations into smaller parts, that can then be distributed across different cores/machines in order to carry them out faster. In the context of big data, it is a good practice to use <u>pure</u> functions for the map operations to ensure reproducibility, correctness and robustness of the results."
