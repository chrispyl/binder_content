    "In the previous notebook, we saw how to use the `map` operation to work elementwise with collections of data. `Map` is suitable for transforming each element of a collection <u>individually</u>, but it cannot be applied in cases where the required transformations involve more than one element of the same collection. For the latter cases, we have a technique called `reduce`. `Reduce` is used to combine all the elements of a collection into a single result. The function `reduce` takes two elements each time, applies the function that was given as argument, and carries over the result. "

Associative operations are those where the result will always be the same, no matter how we group the elements of the collection and apply the function.

    "In many agricultural applications locations are represented with coordinates based on [Geographic Coordinate Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system). Those coordinates are usually *latitude* (north/south) and *longitude* (east/west). We can use those coordinates to find the southernmost point from location data that contain the latitude and longitude of each location. First we have to define a function that compares two pairs of coordinates. We could write this function in a way to compare all the coordinates in the same function, but this would probably be inefficient. Instead, we write this function to compare pairs of coordinates and then supply to reduce. In this way, a big data application would be able to divide the work over multiple computers and combine the results later."
