    "This notebook's topic is about **pure functions**. We have already seen that functions are ‘packets’ of code, which receive inputs (through arguments) and produce outputs (through return values). Functions can be used to calculate formulas, but also to write data to files, interact with users, etc. But when is a function a **pure** function? To understand this, we first need to introduce two properties that characterize the operation of functions. These properties are **determinism** and **side-effects**. We will start with a short re-cap of what this means, and then we'll see a couple of examples to help us recognize pure functions in Python."

    "#### <u>Deterministic functions</u>\n",
    "When a function produces the <u>same outputs</u> when supplied with the <u>same inputs</u>, this function is called ***deterministic*** (the result can and will be determined from the input only). For example, a mathematical function like *addition*, which adds two values, will always give the same result when the same two values are given as arguments. But a function that makes use of a value that was not given as argument (such as using the current computer clock time in a calculation) may give a different result depending on the situation."

    "Continuing to another property, when a function <u>changes</u> a part of a program <u>outside of the function</u> itself, we say that this function has ***side-effects*** (it is affecting its environment). A side-effect could be for example that the value of a variable outside the scope of a function has changed, or that something has been printed on screen, because of the function."

    "#### <u>Pure functions</u>\n",
    "Functions that are deterministic and have no side-effects are called **pure functions**. The use of pure functions is helpful in ensuring the correctness of our programs. If we use only pure functions, then our outcomes will be always predictable and reliable, because they do not depend on anything other than our functions and our input parameters. This is also a very important prerequisite for big data: if we use only pure functions, then it doesn't matter on which computer the function is executed, or by whom, or at what moment in time. The function result is always the same when the same input is used (deterministic), and the function result is independent of the situation (no side-effects). The use of pure functions makes it easy to divide a big data task over multiple computers."

These return values must be assigned to variables, be printed, saved to files, passed on to other functions, or otherwise they will be lost.

We see in the example above that the return value of the call to the `max` function is stored in variable **x** in `x = max(0,3)`. But this is not a side effect, because function `max` itself does not change the value of **x**. The function's return value is stored in **x** immediately *after* the call to `max`. That assignment is indeed changing the environment, because the value of **x** changes, but the assignment isn't part of the function `max` itself. So `max` is a function without side-effects."
