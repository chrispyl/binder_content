    "\n",
    "`Map` and `reduce` operations are combined into a workflow for data transformations called **mapReduce**. As the name suggests, in this workflow the functions are first mapped to data. Then, the results go through a `reduce` operation, to arrive at a single result. This workflow allows a high degree of parallelization since both operations are parallelizable and as a result suitable for working with large amounts of data. "
