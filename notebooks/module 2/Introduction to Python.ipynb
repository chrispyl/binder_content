If you have programmed before but it was a long time ago, or in another programming language, this introduction will refresh your memory.

If not, we suggest that you learn some more Python before you do our tutorials, see our Further Reading suggestion at the bottom."

    "#### <u>Variables</u>\n",
    "Variables are small pieces of memory that can store a value. They have a **name**, which makes it easy to retrieve the **value**. We define a variable by **assigning** a value to it, using the = sign. We can assign a new value as often as we want, it will overwrite the previous value. We assign values to variables in the following way (you can also define a few variables of your own). We can use the print statement to see the variable value on screen."

An **integer** is a number that can be written without its fractional component. A **float** is a decimal number. A **boolean** can hold as value either *True* or *False*. In Python, the value that is given to a variable during assignment determines the type of the variable. The type of the variable determines what operations it accepts. For example, a string variable cannot do multiplication. Here are some examples: "

We can change the order of execution by including a **conditional statement (`if`)**: Only execute this (indented) part of code if the condition is true, otherwise skip it. We can also repeat parts of the code by a **control structure (`for` loop)**: repeat this (indented) part of the code as many times as is indicated, and then continue. We will now see examples of both conditional and repetitive execution."

For example, **lists** have methods to *count*, *sort* or *append* items to the list (and more). A method works just like a function, but it has a different notation: using a full stop. For example, if we had a list called `my_list` and we wanted to sort it, we would say: `my_list.sort()`. If we had defined a function `sort` for it, we would need `my_list` as argument, `sort(my_list)`. But now that `sort` is a method, it's clear that it's called for the datastructure before the full stop: `my_list`, and no argument is given. Of course if any other arguments are needed, they should still be provided. For example, the method `count` needs to know which element should be counted, so that should be provided as an argument.
